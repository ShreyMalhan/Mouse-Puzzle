# Mouse-Puzzle

Mouse Puzzle is a game to check if the mouse can escape the maze.
The maze is given in a form of a text file.

The repository contains two files. One is the .c file which contains the code to test the maze and other is a .txt file which gives a sample maze to test the code.

To Run The Code: Insert the path of the text file you want to run with the code in the loadMaze() function and run the code.
